PHONEGAP  (works on the mac)

phonegap create myapp

phonegap run ios

phonegap run android

phonegap build ios
	-- look under "myapp" --> "platforms" --> "ios" for the .xcodeproj

phonegap build android (does not work yet)
 	(now works - well, almost)

	I have just installed Android Studio 0.2.2 and want to add the sdk tools to path which are in this folder;
/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/sdk/tools



	Use open ~/.bash_profile within the console.

	Write this two lines: 
	export PATH=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk/tools:$PATH 
	and 
	export PATH=/Users/username/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH
